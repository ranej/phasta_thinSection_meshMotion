### What follows is a short manual and is not read by AcuStat ###
This Script is primary used to accumulate the statistics from the ybar field and write the solution from the last time step.
This script can also handle additional fiels. In summary, it writes the following fields: 
        1) solution of the last time step;
        2) accumulated ybar field;
        3) If requested (optional), accumulated error field.
        4) If requested (optional), accumulated phase average fields.
        5) If requested (optional), vorticity field (from the last time step).
        6) If requested (optional), dwal field (from the last time step).
The next lines contain the time steps series for restart files along with the associated number of time steps inside the ybar, error and yphavg fields
