NOTES on building phasta.:
the usual command line is

ARCHOS needs to be specified when ever the build target is different from the native
ARCHOS of the build machine.

gmake [ VERSION=xyz ] [ COMPRESSIBLE=1 ] [ VERS=opt ]  
PARALLEL=[ mpich2, mpigm,mpivmi,sunmpi,sgimpi,decmpi,ibmmpi]

VERSION needs to be specified if the source base is in the dirtory structure
phSolver/xyz/phSolver

PARALLEL can take any of the values specified above based on the target architechture
and mpi build one would like to use.

if PARALLEL=mpich2 is specified, we also need to specify a MPICOMM type ch_shmem or
ch_p4. the comm type also has a -icc extension for the intel compiler based builds on
linix.

at the moment phasta expectes the libraries phastaIO, shapeFunction and metis to have a
-$(PARALLEL) extension on them...simple symbolic links should suffice.


9/17/2007 KJ
After severe neglect we are back to version control.  We start with a rollback to 1.9_7b and then bring AMG into the main trunk.
EXPORT environment variable AMG  to include (AMG=1) or exclude (AMG=0) AMG specific code.  Note if you include you have to either compile your own PARPACK libraries or link to those compiled by someone else (sunc2 or kjansen).  They are not put into SVN because they the only changes that have been made are those contained within the download instructions. Note there is also now a directory under phSolver called AMG.  If you are looking to build AMG code you will need to execute the Makefile in that directory between the common build and the incompressible build.



5/3/2006 KJ
Fixed several places that compressible code was broken in the 3 previous commits.
Modified the Makefile so that it gets the MKL libraries properly under their current placement.  This is a temporary fix that hopefully will move into the buildUtil environment soon.


4/20/2006 EB
two files were added: symline.c and shptri.c

1/16/2006 EB TAGGED as v1_9_8
phasta works with 2D meshes for scalar solve (advection diffusion) with specified initial velocity.

July 28 2005  TAGGED AS v1_9_7b
Stanford deformable wall and generalized outflow boundary conditions merged onto top of the trunk.  Ditched the use of common.h by .c functions (instead used extern of phasta_iotype.  Also adopted Nathan's changes to partition.cc.

v1_9_5 September 24th 2003
Makefiles changed to so that executables are always relinked.
newshape.cc indented for readability

September 12th 2003
v1_9_4

make file changes to avoid automatic override of ARCHOS 
removed unnecessary defines. 
removed all references to MPI to buildUtil, all parallel builds must
specify a value of PARALLEL and potentially an MPICOMM(ch_shmem/ch_p4)

PARALLEL can take values ( mpich2, mpigm, ibmmpi, mpivmi, summpi,
                           sgimpi, decmpi )
mpivmi is for ia64_linux( mpich built on VMI )

MPICOMM needs to be specified only for PARALLEL=mpich2

MPINATIVE is nolonger a valid build option, one needs to  use
PARALLEL={arch}mpi

v1_9_0 

Branch for windows returns to the tree.  This version also uses SCOREC
makefiles and as such has a makefile in each of the three
subdirectories (common makes a library that is used by incompressible
or compressible). Many files have changed but almost all in a superficial way 


1)removal of stdcall for intel which was a digital fortran need (now using Intel compiler for the fortran).

2) SCOREC makefiles wanted cc instead of cpp

3) mpistub.f90 is gone so now you have to get mpich for windows

There are bug fixes for surface tension relative to the earlier version as 
well and restart.latest.<nproc> should again work..

1) (IC) bflux now uses phastaIO and flux array is written into restart file
2) (IC) bflux correctly accounts for periodicity
3) (IC) bugs in discontinuous field reconstruction (second derivative of velocity and normal) were resolved which should fix surface tension bug
4) (IC) fixed lumped mass scalar bug
5) ascii I/O is now supported with iotype variable set in solver.inp (almost)
6) somewhat improved messages in readnblk.f with regard to non-fatal reading errors.
7) (IC) fixed a bug in the lhs for the scalar solver.  It was not accounting for the phi_{,t} term in the stabilization tangent.
8) (IC) scalar can be run as Galerkin.  After 7) we have verified that scalar advection diffusion converges to requested solver tolerance (as a linear problem should)


March 31, 2003
Fixed a bug in compressible/itrdrv.f: the second argument to the final call of
 Bflux was ac.  To get restart behavior consistent with continuous running, we
 now pass acold instead.

March 10, 2003
Fixed a bug in common/settauw.f:  iLES.ge.0 was being used as a condition upon
 which we use LES quantities for near-wall modeling.  Sadly, these quantities
 are only present when iLES.gt.0, so this is the condition we adopt instead.

Cleaned up a number of bugs and made it DEC compliant (mostly harmless "bugs")

Modified the way scalar parameters are handled:
  a) solver tolerance
  b) number of solves per LHS formation
  c) limiting

In the incompressible code, temperature is also afforded the same type of descriptors

The easiest way to understand the above two changes is to compare input.config of this version to an earliear version.

To add the capability to change the number of solves per LHS formation to scalars required rewiring the use of iprec and ilhs back into the scalar routines. This was "cleaned up" throughout the code with iprec and ilhs flags being set at the itrdrv.f level with the exception of matrix free where it changes.

Returned the option to use pressure outflow boundary condition for the compressible code in the "entropy variable W" form. Default is to simply zero res(:,1) but if you set
      Entropy Form of Pressure Constraint on Weight Space: 1  # 1 turns it on
you will get what the name implies (see bc3res.f).

Fixed a bug that prevented you from solving the second scalar without solveing the first.  We were trying too hard to save memory when allocating the LHS matrix.

Some of the changes above have "taken over" arrays previously used for iteration sequences.  As this capability has long been depricated, in this version forward it is officially pronounced DEAD.

The above routines:

1) added auto-sponge wherein a flow can be forced to remain close to
   its initial condition by a cooling body force where the target flow
   state is set to be the initial condition

2) First cut at a DES (Detatched Eddy Simulation) model
   added. Basically the code solves both RANS (Spalart-Allmaras) and any
   of the LES models and uses a user specified edge length as a switch to
   govern which local eddy viscosity to use.  This necessitated:

	iturb replaced by iRANS and iLES which are both set when DES is the 
              selected model.
        eLES  the edge length set by "DES Edge Length" in solver.inp
	blend of viscosities in getdiff

3) First steps towards a common getDiff (e3visc.f removed from incompressible 
   and renamed getDiff

4) xmudml is now xmudmi (since it is at quadrature points not local nodes) 
   and is now correctly dimensioned throughout code (along with strl)

5) scatnu made its way to common

6) gensvb had a bug that distributed piecewise constant boundary flux
   data (what is provided by NSpre) to all nshlb shapefunction
   coefficients (which means that quadratic and higher modes had this
   value).  Now it is only distributed to vertices.

The above routines changed to incorporate the k-epsilon model into the incompressible code.  Other minor fixes to a misplaced tdecay in input_fform.cpp.
Note also that scalar solver tolerances must now be individually set (default for all is 1.0e-3) in both the compressible and incompressible code (see input.config). Incompressible scalars can also now be solved using the conservation restoring velocity. In this way if one can work with the advective form and still have conservative scalars (as is the case with flow).

Re-instated matrix tau and extended it to higher order cubics 
Added timeseries through arbitrary points including higher order
eliminated e3cool.f (this technique is in e3source now)

Changed restart naming convention.  Now a soft link is created and updated for the last restart (restart.lastest.[1..nproc]).  This can be nice for script chained jobs at ncsa sinc tarred solution files can go one way while the restart needed to restart the calculation is put elsewhere (without having to know its name).  To disable this feature simply remove restart.latest.* and old behavior of looking for numstart.dat and reading the restart that it points to is recovered.

To facilitate transitions from RANS to LES a flag was created to turn off source terms to scalar (turbulence model) equations.  
A second flag was created to force the decay of the scalar fields according to

s_{n+1}=df*s{n}

where df is the decay factor.

Source term for a harmonic oscillator has been added.

Compressible code now also uses minIters and maxIters like ACUSIM
solver. WARNING this may change regression test values unless you set
minIters to be 1 as it was before. WARNING II note that the word ACUSIM has been removed from the key phrases

     Minimum Number of Iterations per Nonlinear Iteration: 5  # minIters
     Maximum Number of Iterations per Nonlinear Iteration: 50 # maxIter

Rational for change is that you typically spent quite  bit of time forming the LHS, if you have a loose tolerance that is satified quickly you might as well solve it a bit better after investing the CPU time in forming a LHS.  This argument is diminished if you are able to reform LHS infrequently. Currently, only minIters is used in the compressible code but consolidation effort underway to address duplicity of this with nGMRES and Kspace.

Significant memory savings for dynamic model
   introduced maxnint to common (it tells the maximum numberof integration 
   points FOR A SPECIFIC RUN which allows savings of memory)
split turbvar block to avoid strange behavior
ivart was still being used, now iconvflow is used correctly in its place
Major cleanup of two phase flow work including addition of surface tension to incompressible flow


bugfixes
shapefunctions mis-dimensioned in e3q
MAXSH=32 NOT 125
several asb* and e3q routines had benign misdimensioning problems (benign because array was not used).
bugs in DC lhs

Bug fixes
1) locblkb bug in settauw.f
2) cubic quadrature rule fixed
3) qpbc moved to common
4) removed the inline absolute values on pointers to ien (this confuses people at the very least and may have been a performance hit in fortran90)

KAPL REPORTED CHANGES
 K1) bardmc.f and getdmc.f  nsons(nshg)->nsons(nfath)
 K2) x and shape functions passed into BCint.f
 K3) genbc.f now uses nenl (properly) instead of nen
 K4) genini gets shape functions (for K2)
 K5) dec-> decalp for ifdefing in c routines
 K6) 1 point quadrature added for wedges
 K7) extra arrays removed from solvecon.f
 K8) rotating frame added back to incompressible code
 K9) surface forces added to forces.f
K10) itrdrv now checks at each step to see if job should be stopped


11/15/01

Fixed a bug that was preventing us from using the temporally averaged
dynamic model without wall functions. rwvelb.f now writes
bar.<stepno>.<procno> instead of velb.<stepno>.<procno>.  In that file
you may find the y field averaged over the past runs, the dynamic
model numerater and denominator coefficient or both.

This commit also brought in changes to the sponge as needed for the
jet simulation (from 1 diameter to 1.5 diameters downstream).  Changes
only in e3source.f

not yet tagged changes 

commu can now handle multiple communications per processor boundary
(bi-directional).

parallel scalars now work (for sgi only as it was a bug in the solver
library and other architectures have not been updated yet).
appropriate changes were also made to file usr.c, routine myflesnew


STEP sequence size removed from input.config since it is calculated now
