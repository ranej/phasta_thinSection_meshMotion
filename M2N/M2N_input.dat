120 # time step of the restart files for fields to reduce (solution, ybar, etc)
100 # time step of the restart files for partID and vtxID (mapping between M and N)
1 # Reduce the ybar field? (0/1)
1 # Reduce the error field? (0/1)
2 # Reduce the phase_average field? (0/n phase average fields)
1 # Reduce the vorticity field? (0/1)
1 # Reduce the dwal? (0/1)
1 # Print debug statement (0/1)

### What follows is a short manual and is not read by M2N ###
This Script is used to reduce different fields from M parts to N parts, using the mapping fields (partID. vtxID) gerenated by phParAdapt.
By default, this script reduces the solution field but it can also handle others fields such as mentioned above.
