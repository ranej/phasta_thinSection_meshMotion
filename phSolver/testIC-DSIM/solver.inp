# PHASTA Version 1.5 Input File
#
#  Basic format is
#
#    Key Phrase  :  Acceptable Value (integer, double, logical, or phrase
#                                     list of integers, list of doubles )
#

# To find the Key Phrases, first look in input.config.  There you will
# find the default values for everything that is allowed to have a
# default. Some things are not allowed to default and must be entered
# in this file.  In most cases, the acceptable inputs also appear in
# the input.config file. To add acceptable inputs you should only have
# to modify:

#     input_asci.cc :which matches the string and translates it to the 
#                    parameter change. If it is a new parameter, you must
#                    modify:
#
#                      common.h (to carry new parameter through code)
#                      common_c.h (to carry the parameter from C to Fortran)
#     
#
# In case it is not clear by now, # allows you to comment either from the 
# beginning of the line or to the right as shown below.

#This last one is brand new.  It allows you to construct your step 
#from elementary operations.  It works under the premise that a step is
#constructed from from a series of solves and updates.  The table goes like
#this:
#     solve flow =  0;             update flow =  1
# solve scalar 1 = 10;         update scalar 1 = 11    
# solve scalar 2 = 20;         update scalar 2 = 21    
# solve scalar 3 = 30;         update scalar 3 = 31
#              :                             :
# solve scalar n = n*10;       update scalar n = n*10+1
# solve heat     = (n+1)*10;          update T = (n+1)*10+1
#

#  Below we have an example of solving the flow with two iterations
# (solve, update, solve,update) what would have been achieve before by
# setting niter=2

#
#STEP SEQUENCE 
#{
#      Step Construction  : 0 1 0 1    # this is the standard two iteration
#     Step Construction  : 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1  
      Step Construction  : 0 1       # this is the standard one iteration 
#      Step Construction  : 0 1 10 11
#      Step Construction  : 0 1 10 11 0 1 10 11 0 1 10 11 20 21 20 21 20 21
# This one is one Tony might like where the solver would solve the flow with 
# the first scalar (3 times with an update immediately after each solve) 
# followed by 3 successive solves of the second scalar (with an update after 
# each solve)
#


# NOTE: An update consists of adding the delta from the appropriate
# solve to the appropriate part of the Y vector, followed by
# reapplication of the boundary conditions. You have to ask for an
# update. It is not implicit that it will follow each solve.  This is to
# enable you to solve successive pieces BEFORE updating the solution as
# is sometimes convenient/necessary. Here is an example of that

#      Step Construction  : 0 1 10 20 11 21 0 1 10 20 11 21
# here we solve the flow, update the flow, solve scalar 1, solve scalar 2 (BEFORE UPDATING SCALAR 1) then update both scalars,  then repeat the process
